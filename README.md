> Repos for project I am working on at MSSA.  This is only a reference for the future outcome.  This readme will serve me as Readme Whiteboard.

The purpose of this application is to empower the image features on the google map (During research, I learned that google actually alraedy have exact same feature as my application is intending to do).  Let users upload photos ~~to almost-exact location of the location where the photo is taken,~~ so that others who visit the location on the map will have better understanding of the location.
